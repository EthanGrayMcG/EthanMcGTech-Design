<p> <font size= 5> With my experience, I Have so far only been in child productions, where the whole cast 
is middle school or high school children. And so often times, the parents of the children will sign
 them up for the show and then they will go to weekly rehearsals to start memorizing material.  Often 
 times, material for the audition will be introduced at about the second or third rehearsal. The director
 would then hand out excerpts from the script that you would need to read and then you would also sing a song 
 from the score and sometimes do a demonstrated dance routine. So, the director would they send the 
 information and then you would practice it for the actual audition. Often times, since I have a baritone- Base
 voice, I have often opted to sing a Frank Sinatra song, which has suited my voice better at each audition
 that I have been through.  So, once the auditions have been done, the director will send out a cast list to
 each person who received a role and then at the next rehearsal you will receive a fullscript and do a read 
 through with your newly earned part.  And then, the director will start to block each scene in the show, and
 so in the script book that you receive, you will want to remember to always write down the blocking that is 
 given to you so that you do not remember it.  And to help you faster, you should use standard stage abbreviations- 
<br> 
SR- Stage Right
<br>
SL- Stage Left
<br>
CS- Center Stage
<br>
And so on and so forth. There are tons of Theater abbreviations that can be used in scripts,
 that sometimes it is hard to translate them all. 
And so, once the whole show is blocked, the whole cast will go through several run through 
continuing to touch things up, and then about a week or so before the show opens, there will
 be tech rehearsals were the tech director and his/her will help him has he/she figures out 
 sound and lights and microphones. 

And then show day will come and the whole cats will arrive just a bit early to check everything
 over and get ready. And then you will perform the show for a large audience- often times more
 than once- and it is important to not stress out and to take several deep breaths before you get
 on stage and if you forget your lines or movements suddenly- just Improv it!
