<p> <font size= 5> Medieval theater as always been thought as a form of entertainment or as a way of passing time back in the Medieval Ages.
 Most stories that were performed were stories from the bible, but after a long period of time, the culture slowly moved 
 out of that phase and into a new one were they created new stories from the imagination and not just from the bible- 
 which caused them to have religious substance. Most Medieval Theater started around the fall of the Roman Empire. 
 It could have been that the Romans were very strict on a no entertainment policy ot it could have just been that the 
 people who had suffered from the rule of the Romans were just rejoicing in the fact they they were finally done and they 
 invented or had just used theater as a form of celebration or theaterpy like sort of thing. So, around the collapse of the 
 Roman Empire there was a small group of street performers who went around to these different towns to perform and entertain
 for the general public that gathered in the town square to listen and watch these entertainers. Kind of like the jester that a 
 king might have to kepp himself entertained. </font></p>

<p> <font size= 5> When you act on stage, one funds that they have more control over their character and how the story is told. Where as,
 with film you have a very hard core specific scrpit that you would have to follow and there is no tweaking with the script 
 where as with a theater script, you and the director are given the freedom to tweak and change the dialogue and script as 
 much as you want. With film, the story is set in stone and there is no changing it to fit you, but with theater, that is all
 left up to the imagination of the Director and the cast performing the show. 
<br>
There are also several different acting techniques that are unique to specifically Stage acting and Film acting. Most times, 
on stage you have to add more enthusiasm to your body actions or movement and often times your voice to, so that people all 
the way in the back of the theater can hear and see you.  With on screen acting, that is not always necessary. Often times,
 you can make your actions really small and still me noticed. And with film, the directors will edit wat was filmed so that 
 it is the very best, and now days they have such high technology were they can amplify your voice or even take your action 
 look bigger, or just in general add things that you did not do on camera.</font></p>
