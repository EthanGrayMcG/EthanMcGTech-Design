<p> <font size= 5> Although the start of the history of film is not clearly defined, the commercial, public screening of 
ten of Lumière brothers' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of
 projected cinematographic motion pictures. There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings 
 but these lacked either the quality or the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into a 
 worldwide success.
And soon after, film production companies were established all over the world. The first decade of motion 
picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry.
The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long and without recorded sound.
During the 1890s films became several minutes long and started to consist of several shots. The first film 
studios were built in 1897. The first rotating camera for taking panning shots was built in 1898. Special 
effects were introduced and film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, began
to be used.
And over more long periods of time film as continued to grow and expand, and still to this day, film directors
are using new editing tools adding new things to every film that is produced in this day and age.</font></p>
